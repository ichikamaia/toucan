# man this sucks

yeah, i know

opening issues is the easiest way to contribute. don't worry about duplicates.

prs are great too. some helpful resources:
- https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/docs/cl_respect.md
- https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/developer/

anything helps. follow first principles thinking.
