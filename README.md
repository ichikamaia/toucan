# toucan

an alternative frontend for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)

## quick start

Run ComfyUI from its repo root with:

```bash
python main.py --front-end-version ichikamaia/toucan@latest
```

If your Python is named differently or you use a venv, adjust accordingly (e.g. `py -3.12`, `./.venv/bin/python`, etc.).

For the latest alpha builds (GitHub prereleases):
```bash
python main.py --front-end-version ichikamaia/toucan@prerelease
```

`@latest` tracks the newest stable release. `@prerelease` tracks the newest prerelease (e.g. `alpha.N`) and may be less stable.

## mission

an unobtrusive, lightweight comfyui client that lets you do your best work.
